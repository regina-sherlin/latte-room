# What is this project? 
  * This website is built for a fictional website as a design challenge from - [FrontEnd Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef)
  * My task was to build the website as close to the design as possible. The designs were shared as figma assets and I had to translate it into a functioning website.
  
# What is it built with? 🏗️
  * It was built with HTML, CSS (pre-processors like SASS) and JavaScript
 
# What have I learnt in the process? 🤸
  * I have got a hold of CSS grids, flexbox and pseudo elements. I need to practice them a bit more in other projects to be proficient.
  * I think I am more comfortable with building a basic format and structure of a landing page.
 
 # Things to add in the future ⌚
 * I would like to make it responsive for mobile device screens.
